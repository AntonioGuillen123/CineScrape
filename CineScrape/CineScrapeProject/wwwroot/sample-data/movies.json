    "description": "Have Exodus Explorers found the evidence for Mount Sinai? Filmmaker Timothy Mahoney completes his 20-year search for the true location of the mountain where God gave the ten commandments. In the conclusion of a two-part series, Mahoney uses the Mount Sinai Scorecard to investigate the final three of the six most popular locations proposed for Mount Sinai. Could Mount Sinai actually be Har Karkom, in Israel\u0027s Negev desert, strewn with thousands of pieces of rock art? Might the mountain be at one of two locations in Saudi Arabia? Mt. Bedr, a recently active volcano, or Jabal al Lawz where explorers claim abundant evidence matches the events of the Exodus? See an amazing pattern of evidence and decide for yourself the mountain where Moses and the Israelites met and worshiped God.",

    "description": "Directed by Academy Award\u00AE nominee Paul Schrader based on his original screenplay, MASTER GARDENER follows Narvel Roth (award-winner Joel Edgerton), the meticulous horticulturist of Gracewood Gardens. He is as much devoted to tending the grounds of this beautiful and historic estate, to pandering to his employer, the wealthy dowager Mrs. Haverhill (three-time Academy Award\u00AE nominee Sigourney Weaver). When Mrs. Haverhill demands that he take on her wayward and troubled great-niece Maya (Quintessa Swindell) as a new apprentice, chaos enters Narvel\u0027s spartan existence, unlocking dark secrets from a buried violent past that threaten them all.",

    "description": "When a little girl has a terrible accident and slips into a coma, she finds herself thrust into a darkly surreal industrial dreamworld. Haunted by a nightmarish spectre that feeds off her tears, she must follow her mother\u0027s radio-static voice to find her way back to consciousness. Shot on expired 35mm film stock with vintage rehoused lenses, MOON GARDEN is a fantastical odyssey and a visionary, handcrafted, and fully practical work of art that shows how a child can shine light even in the darkest places.",

Certain their suspect is a scorned ex-lover, Viv\u00E9s is confronted with another, more complicated question: which one? Based on a true crime book by Pauline Gu\u00E9na, The Night of the 12th is a gritty mystery that\u0027s \u0022both highly effective and brilliantly acted, where procedures and mindsets reveal a frayed society\u0022 (Cineuropa), posing uneasy questions about the male-dominated world of law enforcement, and their ability to handle the violent crimes routinely perpetrated against women victims.",

    "description": "A quietly powerful look at the ripple effects of opioid addiction, STAY AWAKE explores addiction from the lesser-seen viewpoint of the caretakers--in this case teenaged brothers Oleff and Argus. Their mother, played by Metz, is loving and well-meaning but powerless to pull herself out of the destructive cycle of her disease. The boys must put their dreams on the backburner as they\u0027re constantly discovering their mom passed out, dragging her to the hospital, and encouraging to go to rehab--with the possibility of relapse always lingering. Anchored by three superb performances, STAY AWAKE finds surprising humor and humanity amid the tragedy of parental addiction.",

Over thirty years later, in a remote town in New Mexico, the $160 million dollar painting was rediscovered in the unlikeliest of places.",

    "description": "20-year-old Samnang and two of his friends live in the White Building, a landmark tenement in Phnom Penh. In this fast-changing city, the three boys practice their dance routine dreaming of television talent contests while their parents lead a more traditional lifestyle. But the White Building is to be demolished. Samnang observes his father unsuccessfully attempting to bring together his divided neighbors on the government\u0027s compensation offers for residents to move out, and he must face his best friend\u0027s departure from Cambodia. Samnang finds that the stable environment he has always called home is on shaky ground.",

    "description": "They watch the bright lights from a distance today. The headlines now go to big names with bigger bank accounts. But, they are comfortable in the quiet, it suits them. Yet this quirky team of brilliant engineers--like the Voyager spacecraft they pilot--are pushing the notion of true discovery, traveling among stars propelled only by dwindling sunlight. While the world has moved on to fancier ships and splashier front men--the celestial journey of the aging spacecraft transcends earthly boundaries--from rural South Korea, the Jim Crow South and the U.S./Mexico border to cement a joint commitment to the mission which has traveled the furthest in human history as the clock winds down.",

    "description": "The mundane life of Iravati -- a 29-year-old housewife living in Nanded -- is thrown into mild disarray when she is asked to look after her pregnant sister, Riya, in Hyderabad after complications arise. Triumphing over her irrational fear of traveling alone, she takes on the role of her guardian and caretaker while her brother-in-law, Abhiram, is away for work. Unbeknownst to her, the journey is just the first of many, and there is no smooth sailing. A childhood incident triggers panic attacks and she (literally) latches on to the closest kind stranger; albeit one, who battles demons of his own. Preetam, a seemingly ordinary banker, fosters crippling depression and is haunted by his past. They find solace with each other and forge an unlikely friendship traversing many conversations and a physical as well as metaphorical series of journeys that lead to emotional evolution. They inadvertently give each other the will to truly live. But Preetam harbors a devastating secret that might destroy their relationship and threaten to dismantle everything they believe in if unraveled.",

    "description": "\u0022The wind got up in the night and took our plans away,\u0022 reads the proverb in the opening titles of MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION. It\u0027s a reference to the 1961 plan to build a grand museum in Belgrade as a tribute to Socialist Yugoslavia. Meant to \u0022safeguard the truth\u0022 about the Yugoslav people, the plan never got beyond the construction of the basement. The derelict building now tells a very different story from the one envisioned by the initiators 60 years ago. The cavernous, damp, pitch-dark space is inhabited by the outcasts of a society reshaped by capitalism: a precocious and energetic little girl who earns cash on the street by cleaning car windows with her mother, and their friend, an older woman also living in the basement. In his award-winning, visually stunning and formally daring feature documentary debut, director and cinematographer Srdjan Keca powerfully illuminates the tender relationship between the three women -- a source of refuge, community, and hope -- against the backdrop of a city in transformation.",

As beliefs are challenged and slurs slung, a new frontier in American politics is opening and television news is about to be transformed forever.

    "description": "The youngest of King Triton\u0027s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life -- and her father\u0027s crown -- in jeopardy.",

    "description": "The hottest comic in America, Sebastian Maniscalco joins forces with legendary Italian-American and two-time Oscar winner, Robert De Niro, in the new comedy ABOUT MY FATHER. The film centers around Sebastian (Maniscalco) who is encouraged by his fianc\u00E9e (Leslie Bibb) to bring his immigrant, hairdresser father, Salvo (De Niro), to a weekend get-together with her super-rich and exceedingly eccentric family (Kim Cattrall, Anders Holm, Brett Dier, David Rasche). The weekend develops into what can only be described as a culture clash, leaving Sebastian and Salvo to discover that the great thing about family is everything about family.",

Now, 23 years later, that trip has come back to haunt him as he and his estranged father (Mark Hamill) are kidnapped back to Russia by the mob to atone for something they say he did. Together, Bert and his father must retrace the steps of his younger self (Jimmy Tatro) in the midst of a war within a sociopathic crime family, all while attempting to find common ground in their often fraught relationship.",

    "description": "Beth (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), a popular writer, and her husband Don, a well-liked teacher, share the kind of relationship that truly, seriously, for the love of God cannot be real: that is, they\u0027re actually in love. Even after decades of marriage, parenting, and their own successful careers, their physical spark has somehow not diminished; in fact, they seem to relish the opportunity to share a single ice cream cone and drive others -- including their son, Charlie -- mad. Should it come as a surprise then that his own marriage is in crisis? But when Beth discovers that Don has been untruthful to her about his opinion of her work for years -- Beth\u0027s world comes crashing down. Has their whole relationship been one Big Fat Lie?",

The discovery of a hole in the fence sets in motion a chain of disturbing events as the boys devolve into a Lord of the Flies-like mob mentality that creates and spreads hysteria in this profoundly disturbing coming-of-age drama that unravels like a horror movie while drawing on actual events.",

    "description": "Go behind the scenes of the largest Vermeer exhibition ever mounted, now on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Capturing the imagination of the art world -- with glowing reviews, global publicity, and tickets sold out through the entirety of its run -- the Rijksmuseum\u0027s Vermeer retrospective is nothing short of an historic event. Suzanne Raes\u0027s film follows curators, conservators, collectors, and experts in their joint mission to shine a new light on the elusive Dutch Master. This fascinating documentary reveals everything from the quiet diplomacy required to get the Vermeers to the Netherlands and the new technical knowledge gained by scanning the paintings layer by layer, to the shocking news that one work may not be by Vermeer after all. In the process, we discover how Vermeer was able to depict reality so differently from his contemporaries. But above all, Close to Vermeer shows the infectious love Vermeer\u0027s art inspires. As one curator lovingly puts it: \u0022A good exhibition should change your view of the world. Vermeer can really do that.\u0022",

    "description": "The themes, images, and cultural vernacular of Victor Fleming\u0027s The Wizard of Oz continue to haunt David Lynch\u0027s art and filmography -- from his very first short, The Alphabet, to his latest series, Twin Peaks: The Return. Arguably, no filmmaker has so consistently drawn inspiration -- consciously or unconsciously -- from a single work. Is David Lynch trapped in the land of Oz? If so, can we derive a new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s body of work from taking a closer look at how it intersects and communicates with The Wizard of Oz? In turn, do Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway or The Elephant Man have something to say about the enduring resonance of America\u0027s most beloved holiday movie? Through six distinct perspectives, and narrated by some of contemporary cinema\u0027s most exciting voices, LYNCH/OZ will take us down the proverbial rabbit hole, help us re-experience and re-interpret The Wizard of Oz by way of David Lynch, to deliver a whole new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s symbolism through the lens of his greatest influence.",

    "description": "Jess (Dani Barker) has finally found her hook: secretly filming creepy interactions she encounters via online job listings, and using the kinks of others to fuel her streaming success. For her next episode, she\u0027s been hired by Tom (Luke Cook) to write the ending of a screenplay in a remote, lavish cabin. Once there, the alluring self-proclaimed screenwriter hands her a script in which the two of them are the main characters. This client isn\u0027t what he seems, and even though the money\u0027s great... the real payment here could cost her life. Follow Her is a psycho-sexual thriller which questions the ethical boundaries of social media.",

    "description": "Peter is a misanthropic dwarf hiding from the world in his shabby New York City apartment. But an unexpected visit from his upbeat--and possibly unhinged--neighbor Winona forces him out of his shell and onto an impromptu road trip. Their destination? What she believes to be the site of an upcoming alien visitation in the wilderness of rural Canada. On their increasingly-surreal odyssey, Peter and Winona will encounter bickering lesbian cosplayers, shroom-addled survivalists, and even extraterrestrial highway cops. But the further they go and the more their trauma comes to light, it becomes clear that the only thing more nerve-wracking than being abducted is being alone in the universe.",

    "description": "\u00C9lise thought she had the perfect life: an ideal boyfriend and a promising career as a ballet dancer. It all falls apart the day she catches him cheating on her with her stage backup; and after she suffers an injury on stage, it seems like she might not be able to dance ever again. The path to physical and emotional recovery will lead her away from Paris to a picturesque location in Brittany -- where her friends, a new love and the freedom of contemporary dance will help her reconnect with her father and most importantly, herself. A heartwarming and inspiring story that tells us how sometimes, the worst thing that could happen may turn out to be the best.",
