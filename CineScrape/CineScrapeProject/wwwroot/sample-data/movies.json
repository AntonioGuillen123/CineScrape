As beliefs are challenged and slurs slung, a new frontier in American politics is opening and television news is about to be transformed forever.

one night only, Roger Waters, the creative force behind the golden years of Pink Floyd, presents his first Farewell Tour, \u0022This Is Not A Drill\u0022, Live from Prague, in cinemas around the

Waters will also debut his new song, \u0022The Bar\u0022. Waters will be joined on stage by Jonathan Wilson, Dave Kilminster, Jon Carin, Gus Seyffert, Robert Walter, Joey Waronker, Shanay Johnson, Amanda Belair and Seamus Blake to deliver an unforgettable performance with a call to action to love, protect, and share our precious planet home.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Music","Director:":"Sean Evans, Roger Waters","Release Date (Theaters):":"May 25,

youngest of King Triton\u0027s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life -- and her father\u0027s crown -- in jeopardy.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"PG (Some Scary Images|Action/Peril)","Genre:":"Kids \u0026 family, Musical, Fantasy","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Rob

Even after decades of marriage, parenting, and their own successful careers, their physical spark has somehow not diminished; in fact, they seem to relish the opportunity to share a single ice cream cone and drive others -- including their son, Charlie -- mad. Should it come as a surprise then that his own marriage is in crisis? But when Beth discovers that Don has been untruthful to her about his opinion of her work for years -- Beth\u0027s world comes crashing down. Has their whole relationship been one Big Fat Lie?","characteristics":{"Rating:":"R (Language)","Genre:":"Comedy","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Nicole Holofcener","Producer:":"Stefanie

behind the scenes of the largest Vermeer exhibition ever mounted, now on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Capturing the imagination of the art world -- with glowing reviews, global publicity, and tickets sold out through the entirety of its run -- the Rijksmuseum\u0027s Vermeer retrospective is nothing short of an historic event. Suzanne Raes\u0027s film follows curators, conservators, collectors, and experts in their joint mission to shine a new light on the elusive Dutch Master. This fascinating documentary reveals everything from the quiet diplomacy required to get the Vermeers to the Netherlands and the new technical knowledge gained by scanning the paintings layer by layer, to the shocking news that one work may not be by Vermeer after all. In the process, we discover how Vermeer was able to depict reality so differently from his contemporaries. But above all, Close to Vermeer shows the infectious love Vermeer\u0027s art inspires. As one curator lovingly puts it: \u0022A good exhibition should change your view of the world. Vermeer can really do that.\u0022","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Documentary","Original Language:":"Dutch","Director:":"Suzanne Raes","Producer:":"Ilja Roomans","Writer:":"Suzanne Raes","Release Date (Theaters):":"May 26, 2023 \u00A0Limited","Release Date (Streaming):":"Jul 11, 2023","Runtime:":"1h 18m","Distributor:":"Kino Lorber","Production Co:":"Docmakers , NTR Television"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Gregor J.M.

In this romantic comedy, dealing with the loss of her fianc\u00E9, Mira Ray sends a series of romantic texts to his old cell phone number... not realizing the number was reassigned to Rob Burns\u0027 new work phone. A journalist, Rob is captivated by the honesty in the beautifully confessional texts.

He justifies his actions by saving his earnings in the hope of taking the love of his life, Lucy Miller, out of the harsh and unforgiving Australian outback. Across the country, in his \u0027quest from God\u0027, a serial killer moves from town-to-town executing those he believes to be \u0027sinful\u0027. Hot on his trail are Detectives Albert and Ernest, driven and logical, the pair follow the trail of bodies in an attempt to find and stop the brutal killer.

in Arkansas in the late 1990\u0027s, a troubled 17-year-old named Matthew is slipping into a cycle of alcohol and drugs that looks all too familiar to his single mother, Christy. Desperate to break the cycle, she sends him away for a summer of sobriety and honest work at his grandfather\u0027s place in the Ozark Mountains. Against the hum of cicadas, Matthew comes to know the generational abuse that has happened there--secrets that change how he looks at those closest to him, and at himself.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Justin Blake Crum","Producer:":"Justin Blake Crum, Michael Turner, Cameron Vaughan, Brandon Vedder, Jessica

tells the story of Madison (Emily Tennant, \u0022Riverdale\u0022), a popular social media influencer who is having a lonely and uneventful trip in Thailand despite what she tells her followers on Instagram. While reflecting on her boyfriend canceling the trip, she meets CW (Cassandra Naud, \u0022See\u0022), a fearless and enigmatic traveler who offers to take her to some of the most Instagram-worthy locations. Together they share authentic meals and drinks with locals, discussing the differences between Madison\u0027s online presence and CW\u0027s lack of one. After showing Madison all of the amazing sights, things take a different turn when CW brings her to a surprise location -- a deserted island that is completely off the grid.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Horror, Mystery \u0026 thriller","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Kurtis David Harder","Producer:":"Kurtis David Harder, Tesh Guttikonda, Brandon Christensen, Jack Campbell, Micah Henry","Writer:":"Kurtis David Harder, Tesh Guttikonda, Kurtis David Harder, Tesh Guttikonda","Release Date (Streaming):":"May 26, 2023","Runtime:":"1h 32m","Distributor:":"Shudder","Production Co:":"Octane Entertainment","Aspect Ratio:":"Scope (2.35:1)"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/fRcH1_NKvpt6wVuGAKcelKwBuMI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/231891_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Emily Tennant","character":"Madison"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Cassandra Naud","character":"CW"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/pQPKo8xjchf8ubSPzC7KwHG1Bqo=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/535309_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Sara Canning","character":"Jessica"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/LGbPmXAAZj8z9sQsHP2nuvxm1jY=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/724754_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Rory J.

As her 40th birthday approaches, she starts to feel pressured to settle down and start a family. When the art teacher at Daisy\u0027s school abruptly quits mid-term, Daisy takes it upon herself to give West High School students the art program that they deserve. Through her adopted profession, she begins to question the true meaning of parenthood and how she fits within those boundaries. Daisy, however, doesn\u0027t fancy herself much of an artist. When she meets the local photographer Jack Palmer at an exhibition, she ropes him into her plan and begins to see a new future for herself.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Comedy, Romance, Drama","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Alexander Jeffery","Producer:":"Jency Griffin Hogan, Aaron Hogan, Emily Morrow","Writer:":"Alexander Jeffery, Paul T.O.

the last desperate days of WWII, a solitary prospector (Jorma Tommila) crosses paths with Nazis on a scorched-earth retreat in northern Finland. When the Nazis steal his gold, they quickly discover that they have just tangled with no ordinary miner. While there is no direct translation for the Finnish word \u0022sisu\u0022, this legendary ex-commando will embody what sisu means: a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. And no matter what the Nazis throw at him, the one-man death squad will go to outrageous lengths to get his gold back -- even if it means killing every last Nazi in his path.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"R (Strong Bloody Violence|Language|Gore)","Genre:":"Action, War","Original Language:":"Finnish","Director:":"Jalmari Helander","Producer:":"Petri

Singh, a 1st generation Punjabi-American, has just accepted a last-minute trucking job to Boston which causes a blow-up argument with Preeti, his 37-week pregnant wife, who admits to feeling abandoned. En route to complete this \u0022one final job,\u0022 Kiran discovers Elena,  a 10-year-old Mexican-American stowed away in his trailer. After debating the merits of turning her to the police, Kiran deduces she might be undocumented, and instead resolves to shepherd Elena to her uncle in Maine despite putting his own livelihood in jeopardy. As the pair ride across the changing American landscape, Kiran faces what it means to be a father and Elena learns how to trust again. They connect through family, dreams of the future, and a healthy debate over God\u2019s existence, all while the ghosts of the past, racially charged encounters, and the threat of I.C.E. linger over their journey.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Nardeep Khurmi","Producer:":"Keertana Sastry, Pallavi Sastry, Simon Taufique, Nardeep

The account of Fox\u0027s public life, full of nostalgic thrills and cinematic gloss, will unspool alongside his never-before-seen private journey, including the years that followed his diagnosis, at 29, with Parkinson\u0027s disease. Intimate and honest, and produced with unprecedented access to Fox and his family, the film will chronicle Fox\u0027s personal and professional triumphs and travails, and will explore what happens when an incurable optimist confronts an incurable disease. With a mix of adventure and romance, comedy and drama, watching the film will feel like... well, like a Michael J. Fox movie.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"R (Language)","Genre:":"Documentary, Biography","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Davis Guggenheim","Producer:":"Davis Guggenheim, Annetta Marion, Jonathan King","Release Date (Theaters):":"May 12, 2023 \u00A0Limited","Release Date (Streaming):":"May 12, 2023","Runtime:":"1h 35m","Distributor:":"Apple Original Films","Production Co:":"Concordia Studio"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/0XJrdDpffKLg2i8lbM3hOtIEe6E=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/583_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Michael J.

George Foreman: The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World is based on the remarkable true story of one of the greatest comebacks of all time and the transformational power of second chances. Fueled by an impoverished childhood, Foreman channeled his anger into becoming an Olympic Gold medalist and World Heavyweight Champion, followed by a near-death experience that took him from the boxing ring to the pulpit. But when he sees his community struggling spiritually and financially, Foreman returns to the ring and makes history by reclaiming his title, becoming the oldest and most improbable World Heavyweight Boxing Champion ever.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"PG-13 (Some Sports Violence)","Genre:":"Biography, Drama, Sports","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"George Tillman

Along the way, he meets old friends. As they recall the past, earthly scenes creep into the mists of the Netherworld. Qiu Fu\u0027s life in opera unfolds against the backdrop of a secular upheaval. The \u0022New-New\u0022 Troupe in which he grows up and learns his trade is affiliated with the military. As power shifts, the troupe is cast loose to wander rootlessly through a broken world. Despite this unsettled destiny, shaped by war, famine and political turmoil, Qiu Fu becomes one of the finest clown-role performers in Sichuan opera. And yet, one day he finds himself clapped in a pigsty as a political revolution rages outside. Outside the Ghost City, sitting among familiar faces, Qiu Fu drinks the mandatory bowl of Forgetfulness Soup to erase his memory. A lifetime of hardship, pain and sorrow, all vanish as if they had never been.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama","Original Language:":"Chinese","Director:":"Qiu Jiongjiong","Producer:":"Ding Ding, Yang Jin","Writer:":"Qiu Jiongjiong","Release Date (Theaters):":"May 20, 2022 \u00A0Limited","Release Date (Streaming):":"May 16, 2023","Runtime:":"2h 59m","Distributor:":"Icarus Films"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Yi Sicheng","character":"Qiu Fu"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Guan Nan","character":"Huafeng"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Qiu Zhimin","character":"Pocky"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Xue Xuchun","character":"Chicken Foot"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Gu Tao","character":"Crooky"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/QgMvoxHTUqeqfxS60KsBPMqR0w8=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/SXgSbDr4-_lFSVNyHGJI6DM8AmQ=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvODFkMWFlZjMtZjRhOS00ZDc0LTk1MzEtODhlZmRmNDFmNmUyLmpwZw==","name":"Qiu Jiongjiong","character":"Director"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/QgMvoxHTUqeqfxS60KsBPMqR0w8=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/SXgSbDr4-_lFSVNyHGJI6DM8AmQ=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvODFkMWFlZjMtZjRhOS00ZDc0LTk1MzEtODhlZmRmNDFmNmUyLmpwZw==","name":"Qiu Jiongjiong","character":"Screenwriter"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Ding Ding","character":"Producer"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Yang Jin","character":"Producer"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/3pVMYvTzSBW7WA64nRxkPYdpDYg=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/fvEr4P2MXyeVhQ4YRger4tywTX4=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvZDgxZTEzNzUtOGZmYi00MTM0LTg2MDEtYzg2NjNiODEwMTFiLmpwZw==","name":"Robbin Feng","character":"Cinematographer"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Diao Lili","character":"Original Music"}],"reviews":[{"url_image":"https://resizing.flixster.com/FLVmK9SnnkZF9kh-nLHjiWHvGTY=/fit-in/50x50/v2/http://resizing.flixster.com/nEsnxW72qlS2_X4wgzY-Y9CxA54=/128x128/v1.YzszNzc0O2o7MTk1MzA7MjA0ODsxNjE5OzE2MTk","name":"Dennis Schwartz","message":"An amazingly tense film for fans of Chinese opera and Chinese politics.","full_review":"https://dennisschwartzreviews.com/a-new-old-play/","date":"2023-05-21T00:00:00"},{"url_image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1249207089987301376/IM529qEB_400x400.jpg","name":"Calan Panchoo","message":"It is as multilayered as the traditions of old and as daring as the convictions of new.","full_review":"https://filmthreat.com/reviews/a-new-old-play/","date":"2023-05-16T00:00:00"},{"url_image":"https://resizing.flixster.com/J3AHbZ2dwk3P_Zv15eibZW1sP_0=/fit-in/50x50/v2/http://resizing.flixster.com/HlpG1XU0bB9shnCidmmrFJMbMFY=/128x128/v1.YzsyOTI2O2o7MTk1MzA7MjA0ODs0MDA7NDAw","name":"Kathy Fennessy","message":"At 179 minutes, A New Old Play might seem like a daunting watch, except it\u0027s a lively, lovely film, even in the saddest moments.

On a search to uncover the mysterious circumstances surrounding her father\u0027s death, a newly appointed police officer, Jessica Loren (Jessica Sula) is assigned to the last shift in a decommissioned police station where a notoriously vicious cult saw their demise years prior. The lone officer at the station, she soon finds herself barraged by terrifying paranormal events, and in the process, is taken on a journey during which she learns the shocking truth behind her family\u0027s entanglement with a demented cult leader. MALUM takes the premise of the 2014 festival hit and flips it on its head, thrusting viewers into an unrelenting, adrenaline-fueled, bloody cult nightmare.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Horror","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Anthony DiBlasi","Producer:":"Scott Poiley, Dan Clifton","Writer:":"Anthony DiBlasi, Scott Poiley","Release

space adventurer Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) finds himself the quarry of relentless bounty hunters after he steals an orb coveted by Ronan, a powerful villain. To evade Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with four disparate misfits: gun-toting Rocket Raccoon, treelike-humanoid Groot, enigmatic Gamora, and vengeance-driven Drax the Destroyer. But when he discovers the orb\u0027s true power and the cosmic threat it poses, Quill must rally his ragtag group to save the universe.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"PG-13 (Some Language|Intense Sci-Fi Action/Violence)","Genre:":"Sci-fi, Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Comedy","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"James Gunn","Producer:":"Kevin Feige","Writer:":"James Gunn, Nicole Perlman","Release Date (Theaters):":"Aug 1, 2014 \u00A0Wide","Release Date (Streaming):":"Dec 9, 2014","Box Office (Gross USA):":"$333.7M","Runtime:":"2h 1m","Distributor:":"Walt Disney Pictures","Production Co:":"Marvel Studios, Moving Picture Company, Marvel Enterprises","Sound Mix:":"Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital","View the collection:":"Marvel Cinematic Universe"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/MOBKRyYrsYM7BV8SMC3eIXmTj58=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/249381_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Chris Pratt","character":"Peter Quill"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/9dzDy_YPVGFeEmXI1AM5zC3dgig=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/194024_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Zoe Saldana","character":"Gamora"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/A71IMeipnUdzedbV5bGsAvviAyE=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/566644_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Dave Bautista","character":"Drax the Destroyer"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/sik6yh95ULdMnZ6orUTEDSkdH3A=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/79719_v9_bc.jpg","name":"Vin Diesel","character":"Groot Voice"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/BLH6l3k5i03QrNVWcHRXfOVAyj0=/100x120/v2/https://resizing.flixster.com/_xl_66mOXlkYpfahIXOq2XcUpWs=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMvNWNjNjA3MTQtMGM2My00NTNhLWEyYjMtNGI1ZDc1YzQ2NzcyLmpwZw==","name":"Bradley Cooper","character":"Rocket Voice"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/wL9vswbIDb4sjvMsk6BaFug6PhI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/265843_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Lee Pace","character":"Ronan the Accuser"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/tve5E1Gmqq0ee1Cdwy3r7by1N6E=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/45722_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Michael Rooker","character":"Yondu Udonta"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/lvOIti3z5Drjlh-HhO2kt1ihpmk=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/572089_v9_bd.jpg","name":"Karen Gillan","character":"Nebula"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/9mUUN3D5_7CJZNYo8CJ02Dr1AkE=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/74149_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Djimon Hounsou","character":"Korath"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/sEBFKCbTTOZDIDxC9dKIZSfQWo0=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/75509_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Benicio del Toro","character":"The Collector"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/ouIMF3ZjOHUv5n5ZJMD7sGzIpeg=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/415275_v9_bb.jpg","name":"John C.

is a marvel of artificial intelligence, a life-like doll programmed to be a child\u0027s greatest companion and a parent\u0027s greatest ally. Designed by brilliant toy-company roboticist Gemma (Get Out\u0027s Allison Williams), M3GAN can listen and watch and learn as she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector, for the child she is bonded to. When Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw, The Haunting of Hill House), Gemma\u0027s unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her M3GAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problems--a decision that will have unimaginable

Love and Thunder\u0022 finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he\u0027s ever faced -- a quest for inner peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who -- to Thor\u0027s surprise -- inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher\u0027s vengeance and stop him before it\u0027s too late.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"PG-13 (Intense

Bullet Train, Brad Pitt stars as Ladybug, an unlucky assassin determined to do his job peacefully after one too many gigs gone off the rails.

staying at an isolated island resort, James (Alexander Skarsg\u00E5rd) and Em (Cleopatra Coleman) are enjoying a perfect vacation of pristine beaches, exceptional staff, and soaking up the sun. But guided by the seductive and mysterious Gabi (Mia Goth), they venture outside the resort grounds and find themselves in a culture filled with violence, hedonism, and untold horror. A tragic accident leaves them facing a zero tolerance policy for crime: either you\u0027ll be executed, or, if you\u0027re rich enough to afford it, you can watch yourself die instead.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"R","Genre:":"Horror, Mystery \u0026 thriller, Sci-fi","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Brandon Cronenberg","Producer:":"Andrew Cividino, Rob

fall, everyone\u0027s favorite leche-loving, swashbuckling, fear-defying feline returns. For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award\u00AE nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar\u00AE nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided--against their better judgment--by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guill\u00E9n, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar\u00AE nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, \u0022Big\u0022 Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).","characteristics":{"Rating:":"PG (Rude Humor/Language|Action/Violence|Some Scary

(Aubrey Plaza) is saddled with student debt and locked out of the job market due to a minor criminal record. Desperate for income, she takes a shady gig as a \u0022dummy shopper,\u0022 buying goods with stolen credit cards supplied by a handsome and charismatic middleman named Youcef (Theo Rossi). Faced with a series of dead-end job interviews, Emily soon finds herself seduced by the quick cash and illicit thrills of black-market capitalism, and increasingly interested in her mentor Youcef.

dominating the boxing world, Adonis Creed (Michael B.

college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the

Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian\u0027s true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain and pleasure.","characteristics":{"Rating:":"R (Language|Graphic Nudity|Sexual Dialogue|Some Unusual Behavior|Strong Sexual Content)","Genre:":"Romance, Drama","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","Producer:":"Michael De Luca, E.L.

has escaped from her wealthy and controlling family. As she dances in a strip club, she meets Markos, a small yet charismatic gangster, who helps her run away from her stepfather\u0027s henchmen. Markos soon becomes her protector and lover. He brings her into Broadway, Athens, an abandoned entertainment complex squatted by a small community of dancers, tramps, thieves and a captive monkey. For a while, everything goes well, even when Broadway hosts a mysterious man, injured and covered with bandages, wanted dead by Athens\u0027 most dangerous mafia. However, when Markos gets arrested and imprisoned, the newcomer will take an unexpectedly important place in the gang.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama, Crime","Original

When Leah suffers a mysterious seizure, Maja fears their whirlwind romance might be cut short and decides to follow Leah back to her home in London. There, Maja meets her new downstairs neighbour: Leah\u2019s mother, Chana. An overbearing, seemingly religious and highly secretive woman, Chana seems resistant to all of Maja\u2019s attempts to win her over. And as Maja notices strange occurrences in the building, she begins to suspect that Chana\u2019s secrets could be much darker than first anticipated.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama, Mystery \u0026 thriller, Horror, Comedy, Romance, Lgbtq\u002B","Original Language:":"Danish","Director:":"Gabriel Bier Gislason","Producer:":"Thomas Heinesen","Writer:":"Gabriel Bier Gislason, Gabriel Bier Gislason","Release Date (Streaming):":"Feb 9, 2023","Runtime:":"1h 45m","Production Co:":"Nordisk Film"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/EBf0dmlDuM0nxhj7metT34gL0mQ=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/162752_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Sofie Gr\u00E5b\u00F8l","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/unII0XsyU61H-q2aJ6Z3ZSQEu4Q=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1020740_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Josephine Park","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/HCg8x3xKuGw1kIkaj45NR1y0Hwg=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/568989_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Ellie Kendrick","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/ioYQE-4a7SkL_72cYBzKkJTCIAM=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/357873_v9_bb.jpg","name":"David Dencik","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/NmJdSf8Y8jcjFlTZwYb3a_8IcQI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1796527_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Gabriel Bier Gislason","character":"Director"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/NmJdSf8Y8jcjFlTZwYb3a_8IcQI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1796527_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Gabriel Bier Gislason","character":"Writer"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/dLTLShHo5cFo08kFF1wPE7Xzzj8=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/375834_v9_aa.jpg","name":"Thomas Heinesen","character":"Producer"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Valdemar Cold Winge Leisner","character":"Cinematographer"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/NmJdSf8Y8jcjFlTZwYb3a_8IcQI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1796527_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Gabriel Bier Gislason","character":"Screenwriter"}],"reviews":[{"url_image":"https://resizing.flixster.com/KjjYhq9gPLyV-PXcAuETP-RRbrI=/fit-in/50x50/v2/http://resizing.flixster.com/HwJksAUvVQwWR0R5hvoAkNpvBaA=/128x128/v1.YzsxMDAwMDAyOTY1O2o7MTk1Mzk7MjA0ODsyMjA7MjIw","name":"Gavia Baker-Whitelaw","message":"Rooted in Jewish folklore, this queer horror-comedy sees a woman unexpectedly move in with her girlfriend\u2019s mother \u2013 an eccentric and overbearing figure who seems oddly obsessed with supernatural threats.","full_review":"https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/shudder-attachment-movie-2023-review/","date":"2023-04-06T00:00:00"},{"url_image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1249207089987301376/IM529qEB_400x400.jpg","name":"Shelagh Rowan-Legg","message":"The script gives a great balance in understanding of these three women, and how each has experiences the world differently, and each are operating out of love, even if that manifests in different ways.","full_review":"https://screenanarchy.com/2023/02/review-attachment.html","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00"},{"url_image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1249207089987301376/IM529qEB_400x400.jpg","name":"Gena Radcliffe","message":"Attachment does a lot with mood, and the unfolding mystery of what exactly Maja is walking into.

Arguably, no filmmaker has so consistently drawn inspiration -- consciously or unconsciously -- from a single work. Is David Lynch trapped in the land of Oz? If so, can we derive a new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s body of work from taking a closer look at how it intersects and communicates with The Wizard of Oz? In turn, do Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway or The Elephant Man have something to say about the enduring resonance of America\u0027s most beloved holiday movie? Through six distinct perspectives, and narrated by some of contemporary cinema\u0027s most exciting voices, LYNCH/OZ will take us down the proverbial rabbit hole, help us re-experience and re-interpret The Wizard of Oz by way of David Lynch, to deliver a whole new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s symbolism through the lens of his greatest influence.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Documentary, Biography","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Alexandre O.

But an unexpected visit from his upbeat--and possibly unhinged--neighbor Winona forces him out of his shell and onto an impromptu road trip. Their destination? What she believes to be the site of an upcoming alien visitation in the wilderness of rural Canada. On their increasingly-surreal odyssey, Peter and Winona will encounter bickering lesbian cosplayers, shroom-addled survivalists, and even extraterrestrial highway cops. But the further they go and the more their trauma comes to light, it becomes clear that the only thing more nerve-wracking than being abducted is being alone in the universe.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-fi","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Juan Felipe Zuleta","Producer:":"Leland Frankel, Juan Sebastian Jaimes, Matthew Jeffers,

For her next episode, she\u0027s been hired by Tom (Luke Cook) to write the ending of a screenplay in a remote, lavish cabin.

It all falls apart the day she catches him cheating on her with her stage backup; and after she suffers an injury on stage, it seems like she might not be able to dance ever again. The path to physical and emotional recovery will lead her away from Paris to a picturesque location in Brittany -- where her friends, a new love and the freedom of contemporary dance will help her reconnect with her father and most importantly, herself. A heartwarming and inspiring story that tells us how sometimes, the worst thing that could happen may turn out to be the best.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Comedy, Drama","Original Language:":"French (France)","Director:":"C\u00E9dric Klapisch","Producer:":"Bruno Levy","Writer:":"C\u00E9dric Klapisch, Santiago Amigorena","Release Date (Theaters):":"Jun 2, 2023 \u00A0Limited","Runtime:":"1h 57m","Distributor:":"Blue Fox Entertainment","Aspect Ratio:":"Flat (1.85:1)"},"casts":[{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Marion Barbeau","character":"Elise Gautier"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Hofesh Shechter","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/fywvWHYPs7v5lVuzD8MNZdAohFY=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/168987_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Denis Podalyd\u00E8s","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/LGCeDRuAgof5_QmkLBACE4HTeqc=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/159792_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Muriel Robin","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/ZyRYLCys5E_pkidJRf6eSHbnHR4=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/531319_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Pio Marma\u00EF","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/LgwkzQ9P-wyXBDAV6PFchZ5Hgxk=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/585509_v9_bb.jpg","name":"Fran\u00E7ois Civil","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/SohF6n8uqkPh6Hb2QBlRiungyIY=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1180712_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Souheila Yacoub","character":""},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/4c16-mNwTH-hMnzo24L6G0ctl4M=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/165820_v9_ba.jpg","name":"C\u00E9dric Klapisch","character":"Director"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/4c16-mNwTH-hMnzo24L6G0ctl4M=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/165820_v9_ba.jpg","name":"C\u00E9dric Klapisch","character":"Screenwriter"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/MNiaYKoDbL_tm4l-bgOvyRAuzhc=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/304908_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Santiago Amigorena","character":"Screenwriter"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/PTR_80CsH6g7PbKA8zUaV8r6OaI=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/320175_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Bruno Levy","character":"Producer"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Alexis Kavyrchine","character":"Cinematographer"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/FFdaYe3PoSLKSiV-T--4VcCnkwc=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/629516_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Anne-Sophie Bion","character":"Film Editor"},{"url_photo":"https://img.redbull.com/images/c_crop,x_1676,y_0,h_1310,w_1048/c_fill,w_860,h_1075/q_auto:low,f_auto/redbullcom/2023/2/22/qpctvo5nspffj1vgy3a1/red-bull-click-cabecera","name":"Hofesh Shechter","character":"Original Music"},{"url_photo":"https://resizing.flixster.com/XrD2y-_pDyVOpXFtI03F3pZlAxM=/100x120/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/477031_v9_ba.jpg","name":"Thomas Bangalter","character":"Original Music"}],"reviews":[{"url_image":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1249207089987301376/IM529qEB_400x400.jpg","name":"Pablo V\u00E1zquez","message":"A comforting movie, magnificently orchestrated, also mischievous and placid in its indefiniteness, beautiful and playful...

They formed Hipgnosis in Cambridge during the ferment of the sixties and became rock royalty during the boom time of the seventies. They conjured into existence sights that no one had previously thought possible, produced visuals which popularized music that had previously been considered fringe, and were at the white-hot center of the maddest, funniest and most creative era in the history of popular music. During this period, record companies didn\u0027t dictate to acts like Peter Gabriel, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and Paul McCartney what their LP covers should look like -- Storm and Po did. They made money; they lost money. They did great things; they did silly things. They fell out bitterly; they made up.

Set in New York and Spain in 1974, the film is told through the eyes of James (Christopher Briney), a young assistant keen to make his name in the art world, who helps the eccentric and mercurial Dal\u00ED prepare for a big gallery show.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Biography, Drama","Original Language:":"English","Director:":"Mary Harron","Producer:":"Daniel Brunt, Chris Curling, Edward R.

in occupied France in 1942, Persian Lessons follows Gilles (Nahuel Pe\u0301rez Biscayart), a Belgian Jew, who narrowly avoids sudden execution by swearing to the guards that he\u0027s Persian, not Jewish. While the lie temporarily saves him, Gilles is then assigned the extraordinary task of teaching Farsi, a language he doesn\u0027t know, to Koch (Lars Eidinger), the officer in charge of the camp\u0027s kitchen who dreams of opening a restaurant in Iran once the war is over. Through an inspired and clever deception, Giles not only manages to survive, but also devises an astonishing strategy to remember the names of his condemned brethren.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"History, Drama","Original Language:":"German","Director:":"Vadim Perelman","Producer:":"Ilya Stewart, Murad Osmann, Pavel Burian, Ilja Zofin, Vadim Perelman,

after World War I, veteran Rapha\u00EBl (Rapha\u00EBl Thiery) returns home from the frontlines to find himself a widower, and father to an infant daughter. Raised by her father in rural Normandy, the child Juliette (Juliette Jouan) grows into a lonely young woman who dreams of greater possibilities. She seeks refuge in the nearby woods, where she meets a witch who promises scarlet sails will one day take her away from her village. Reckoning with her future and swept away by a rakish young pilot (Louis Garrel) who literally falls from the sky, Juliette never stops believing in the witch\u0027s prophecy. Tracing Juliette\u0027s journey throughout the 20 years of great invention between the world wars, Scarlet delicately weaves together music and fantasy, history and folklore, realist drama and ethereal romance, to craft a timeless story of a young woman\u0027s emancipation.","characteristics":{"Genre:":"Drama, Romance","Original Language:":"French (France)","Director:":"Pietro
