        "Description": "Have Exodus Explorers found the evidence for Mount Sinai? Filmmaker Timothy Mahoney completes his 20-year search for the true location of the mountain where God gave the ten commandments. In the conclusion of a two-part series, Mahoney uses the Mount Sinai Scorecard to investigate the final three of the six most popular locations proposed for Mount Sinai. Could Mount Sinai actually be Har Karkom, in Israel\u0027s Negev desert, strewn with thousands of pieces of rock art? Might the mountain be at one of two locations in Saudi Arabia? Mt. Bedr, a recently active volcano, or Jabal al Lawz where explorers claim abundant evidence matches the events of the Exodus? See an amazing pattern of evidence and decide for yourself the mountain where Moses and the Israelites met and worshiped God.",

When Mrs. Haverhill demands that he take on her wayward and troubled great-niece Maya (Quintessa Swindell) as a new apprentice, chaos enters Narvel\u0027s spartan existence, unlocking dark secrets from a buried violent past that threaten them all.",

Haunted by a nightmarish spectre that feeds off her tears, she must follow her mother\u0027s radio-static voice to find her way back to consciousness. Shot on expired 35mm film stock with vintage rehoused lenses, MOON GARDEN is a fantastical odyssey and a visionary, handcrafted, and fully practical work of art that shows how a child can shine light even in the darkest places.",

        "Description": "In nearly every police precinct, detectives are inevitably confronted with a case that goes unsolved. The more heinous the crime, the more it haunts those whose duty it is solve it. Such is the dilemma for Yohan Viv\u00E8s--a young, recently promoted police Captain--when he begins investigating the gruesome murder of a young women named Clara in the town of Grenoble. It\u0027s clear that the attack was pre-meditated, and the violent nature of the crime suggests revenge. Viv\u00E9s\u0027 team methodically digs through the details of Clara\u0027s life, uncovering her secrets in hopes of weeding out the killer. Certain their suspect is a scorned ex-lover, Viv\u00E9s is confronted with another, more complicated question: which one? Based on a true crime book by Pauline Gu\u00E9na, The Night of the 12th is a gritty mystery that\u0027s \u0022both highly effective and brilliantly acted, where procedures and mindsets reveal a frayed society\u0022 (Cineuropa), posing uneasy questions about the male-dominated world of law enforcement, and their ability to handle the violent crimes routinely perpetrated against women victims.",

        "Description": "A quietly powerful look at the ripple effects of opioid addiction, STAY AWAKE explores addiction from the lesser-seen viewpoint of the caretakers--in this case teenaged brothers Oleff and Argus. Their mother, played by Metz, is loving and well-meaning but powerless to pull herself out of the destructive cycle of her disease. The boys must put their dreams on the backburner as they\u0027re constantly discovering their mom passed out, dragging her to the hospital, and encouraging to go to rehab--with the possibility of relapse always lingering. Anchored by three superb performances, STAY AWAKE finds surprising humor and humanity amid the tragedy of parental addiction.",

In this fast-changing city, the three boys practice their dance routine dreaming of television talent contests while their parents lead a more traditional lifestyle. But the White Building is to be demolished. Samnang observes his father unsuccessfully attempting to bring together his divided neighbors on the government\u0027s compensation offers for residents to move out, and he must face his best friend\u0027s departure from Cambodia. Samnang finds that the stable environment he has always called home is on shaky ground.",

Yet this quirky team of brilliant engineers--like the Voyager spacecraft they pilot--are pushing the notion of true discovery, traveling among stars propelled only by dwindling sunlight. While the world has moved on to fancier ships and splashier front men--the celestial journey of the aging spacecraft transcends earthly boundaries--from rural South Korea, the Jim Crow South and the U.S./Mexico border to cement a joint commitment to the mission which has traveled the furthest in human history as the clock winds down.",

Triumphing over her irrational fear of traveling alone, she takes on the role of her guardian and caretaker while her brother-in-law, Abhiram, is away for work. Unbeknownst to her, the journey is just the first of many, and there is no smooth sailing. A childhood incident triggers panic attacks and she (literally) latches on to the closest kind stranger; albeit one, who battles demons of his own. Preetam, a seemingly ordinary banker, fosters crippling depression and is haunted by his past. They find solace with each other and forge an unlikely friendship traversing many conversations and a physical as well as metaphorical series of journeys that lead to emotional evolution. They inadvertently give each other the will to truly live. But Preetam harbors a devastating secret that might destroy their relationship and threaten to dismantle everything they believe in if unraveled.",

        "Description": "\u0022The wind got up in the night and took our plans away,\u0022 reads the proverb in the opening titles of MUSEUM OF THE REVOLUTION. It\u0027s a reference to the 1961 plan to build a grand museum in Belgrade as a tribute to Socialist Yugoslavia. Meant to \u0022safeguard the truth\u0022 about the Yugoslav people, the plan never got beyond the construction of the basement. The derelict building now tells a very different story from the one envisioned by the initiators 60 years ago. The cavernous, damp, pitch-dark space is inhabited by the outcasts of a society reshaped by capitalism: a precocious and energetic little girl who earns cash on the street by cleaning car windows with her mother, and their friend, an older woman also living in the basement. In his award-winning, visually stunning and formally daring feature documentary debut, director and cinematographer Srdjan Keca powerfully illuminates the tender relationship between the three women -- a source of refuge, community, and hope -- against the backdrop of a city in transformation.",

        "Description": "Kiran Singh, a 1st generation Punjabi-American, has just accepted a last-minute trucking job to Boston which causes a blow-up argument with Preeti, his 37-week pregnant wife, who admits to feeling abandoned. En route to complete this \u0022one final job,\u0022 Kiran discovers Elena,  a 10-year-old Mexican-American stowed away in his trailer. After debating the merits of turning her to the police, Kiran deduces she might be undocumented, and instead resolves to shepherd Elena to her uncle in Maine despite putting his own livelihood in jeopardy. As the pair ride across the changing American landscape, Kiran faces what it means to be a father and Elena learns how to trust again. They connect through family, dreams of the future, and a healthy debate over God\u2019s existence, all while the ghosts of the past, racially charged encounters, and the threat of I.C.E. linger over their journey.",

When the Nazis steal his gold, they quickly discover that they have just tangled with no ordinary miner. While there is no direct translation for the Finnish word \u0022sisu\u0022, this legendary ex-commando will embody what sisu means: a white-knuckled form of courage and unimaginable determination in the face of overwhelming odds. And no matter what the Nazis throw at him, the one-man death squad will go to outrageous lengths to get his gold back -- even if it means killing every last Nazi in his path.",

Fueled by an impoverished childhood, Foreman channeled his anger into becoming an Olympic Gold medalist and World Heavyweight Champion, followed by a near-death experience that took him from the boxing ring to the pulpit. But when he sees his community struggling spiritually and financially, Foreman returns to the ring and makes history by reclaiming his title, becoming the oldest and most improbable World Heavyweight Boxing Champion ever.",

        "Description": "One evening in the 1980s, Qiu Fu, a leading clown in 20th-century Sichuan opera, departs this world and must reluctantly set off for the Ghost City under the escort of two underworld officials. Along the way, he meets old friends. As they recall the past, earthly scenes creep into the mists of the Netherworld. Qiu Fu\u0027s life in opera unfolds against the backdrop of a secular upheaval. The \u0022New-New\u0022 Troupe in which he grows up and learns his trade is affiliated with the military. As power shifts, the troupe is cast loose to wander rootlessly through a broken world. Despite this unsettled destiny, shaped by war, famine and political turmoil, Qiu Fu becomes one of the finest clown-role performers in Sichuan opera. And yet, one day he finds himself clapped in a pigsty as a political revolution rages outside. Outside the Ghost City, sitting among familiar faces, Qiu Fu drinks the mandatory bowl of Forgetfulness Soup to erase his memory. A lifetime of hardship, pain and sorrow, all vanish as if they had never been.",

        "Description": "From director Ursula Macfarlane (Untouchable) and producer Alexandra Lacey comes an unflinching and humanizing examination of the life, death and secrets of Vickie Lynn Hogan -- better known as model and actress Anna Nicole Smith. From her first appearance in Playboy in 1992, Anna Nicole\u0027s dizzying ascent was the very essence of the American dream, brought to a tragic halt with her untimely passing in 2007. With access to never-before-seen footage, home movies, and interviews with key figures who have not spoken out until now, ANNA NICOLE SMITH: YOU DON\u0027T KNOW ME reveals new insights into the story of the quintessential blonde bombshell hardly anyone really knew.",

His only shot to survive is to uncover the mysterious mastermind behind the deadly plot before it\u0027s too late.

He brings her into Broadway, Athens, an abandoned entertainment complex squatted by a small community of dancers, tramps, thieves and a captive monkey. For a while, everything goes well, even when Broadway hosts a mysterious man, injured and covered with bandages, wanted dead by Athens\u0027 most dangerous mafia.

        "Description": "La Civil tells the story of Cielo, a mother in search of her daughter, abducted by  a criminal gang in Northern Mexico. As the authorities fail to offer support in the search, Cielo takes matters into her own hands. Cielo begins her own investigation and earns the trust and sympathy of Lamarque, an unconventional army Lieutenant working in the region. He agrees to help Cielo in her search, because her research data could be useful to his operations as well. Cielo\u0027s collaboration with Lamarque pulls her further into a vicious cycle of violence. The film focuses on Cielo\u2019s emotional rollercoaster, as she is drawn into increasingly intense and dangerous circumstances. The camera stays close, we never lose sight of her as she gradually transforms from housewife into avenging activist. As events unfold, Cielo gets closer to the truth: discovering a mass grave, obtaining official DNA analyses, confronting one of the presumed kidnappers, but corruption and apathy keep her from finding resolution. Until the end finally comes, unpredictable and uninvited... The story was inspired by true events.",

Distinctive in both style and substance and told virtually in real time, the story weaves together the protagonist\u0027s inner monologue with conversations he has with the people he encounters along the way. Raw, brutally honest, poignant and funny, \u0022Out and About\u0022 explores the contrast between our inner and outer selves, the conflict between old dreams and new realities, and one man\u0027s search for meaning as he wrestles with aging, success and failure in America, and his ultimate place in the world.",

Multi-platinum rap superstar Jack Harlow makes his movie debut as Jeremy, a former star of the game whose injuries stalled his career, and Sinqua Walls stars as Kamal, once a promising player who derailed his own future in the sport. Juggling tenuous relationships, financial pressures and serious internal struggles, the two ballers--opposites who are seemingly miles apart--find they might have more in common than they imagined possible.",

Even after decades of marriage, parenting, and their own successful careers, their physical spark has somehow not diminished; in fact, they seem to relish the opportunity to share a single ice cream cone and drive others -- including their son, Charlie -- mad. Should it come as a surprise then that his own marriage is in crisis? But when Beth discovers that Don has been untruthful to her about his opinion of her work for years -- Beth\u0027s world comes crashing down. Has their whole relationship been one Big Fat Lie?",

The discovery of a hole in the fence sets in motion a chain of disturbing events as the boys devolve into a Lord of the Flies-like mob mentality that creates and spreads hysteria in this profoundly disturbing coming-of-age drama that unravels like a horror movie while drawing on actual events.",

        "Description": "Go behind the scenes of the largest Vermeer exhibition ever mounted, now on view at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Capturing the imagination of the art world -- with glowing reviews, global publicity, and tickets sold out through the entirety of its run -- the Rijksmuseum\u0027s Vermeer retrospective is nothing short of an historic event. Suzanne Raes\u0027s film follows curators, conservators, collectors, and experts in their joint mission to shine a new light on the elusive Dutch Master. This fascinating documentary reveals everything from the quiet diplomacy required to get the Vermeers to the Netherlands and the new technical knowledge gained by scanning the paintings layer by layer, to the shocking news that one work may not be by Vermeer after all. In the process, we discover how Vermeer was able to depict reality so differently from his contemporaries. But above all, Close to Vermeer shows the infectious love Vermeer\u0027s art inspires. As one curator lovingly puts it: \u0022A good exhibition should change your view of the world. Vermeer can really do that.\u0022",

        "Description": "The themes, images, and cultural vernacular of Victor Fleming\u0027s The Wizard of Oz continue to haunt David Lynch\u0027s art and filmography -- from his very first short, The Alphabet, to his latest series, Twin Peaks: The Return. Arguably, no filmmaker has so consistently drawn inspiration -- consciously or unconsciously -- from a single work. Is David Lynch trapped in the land of Oz? If so, can we derive a new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s body of work from taking a closer look at how it intersects and communicates with The Wizard of Oz? In turn, do Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway or The Elephant Man have something to say about the enduring resonance of America\u0027s most beloved holiday movie? Through six distinct perspectives, and narrated by some of contemporary cinema\u0027s most exciting voices, LYNCH/OZ will take us down the proverbial rabbit hole, help us re-experience and re-interpret The Wizard of Oz by way of David Lynch, to deliver a whole new appreciation for Lynch\u0027s symbolism through the lens of his greatest influence.",

        "Description": "Jess (Dani Barker) has finally found her hook: secretly filming creepy interactions she encounters via online job listings, and using the kinks of others to fuel her streaming success. For her next episode, she\u0027s been hired by Tom (Luke Cook) to write the ending of a screenplay in a remote, lavish cabin. Once there, the alluring self-proclaimed screenwriter hands her a script in which the two of them are the main characters. This client isn\u0027t what he seems, and even though the money\u0027s great... the real payment here could cost her life. Follow Her is a psycho-sexual thriller which questions the ethical boundaries of social media.",

        "Description": "Peter is a misanthropic dwarf hiding from the world in his shabby New York City apartment. But an unexpected visit from his upbeat--and possibly unhinged--neighbor Winona forces him out of his shell and onto an impromptu road trip. Their destination? What she believes to be the site of an upcoming alien visitation in the wilderness of rural Canada. On their increasingly-surreal odyssey, Peter and Winona will encounter bickering lesbian cosplayers, shroom-addled survivalists, and even extraterrestrial highway cops. But the further they go and the more their trauma comes to light, it becomes clear that the only thing more nerve-wracking than being abducted is being alone in the universe.",

It all falls apart the day she catches him cheating on her with her stage backup; and after she suffers an injury on stage, it seems like she might not be able to dance ever again. The path to physical and emotional recovery will lead her away from Paris to a picturesque location in Brittany -- where her friends, a new love and the freedom of contemporary dance will help her reconnect with her father and most importantly, herself. A heartwarming and inspiring story that tells us how sometimes, the worst thing that could happen may turn out to be the best.",
